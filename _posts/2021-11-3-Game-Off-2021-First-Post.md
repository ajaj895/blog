title: Game Off 2021 - Bug Hunter
---

I will be participating in the 2021 Game Off hosted by Github and Itch.io

[Find it here](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021)

### This year's theme is: Bug.

So I am taking that theme to the literal extreme. I am combining the theme of insect bugs and combining it somewhat with the theme of spy related bugs (like planting a bug). I will be attempting to create a top down racing/survival arcade game very much inspired by the 1980s Spy Hunter NES game. [The original Spy Hunter looks like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_Hunter)

### Work In Progress Story

At this current moment in time, I have created a very simple story to explain and setup the beginning of the game. It goes a little something like this:

Special agent (insert bug pun here or an actual bug name) has gotten away with evidence from a bug and sting operation against the Arachnid mob that runs these parts of the lawn. Now they are hot on your tail to make sure that evidence never makes it to R.A.I.D. Headquarters. This is a sticky situation, but this evidence is needed in the landmark case against Boss D. Longlegs. It's in your hands, make it back alive.

#### Note this a work in progress story, this will probably change.

I have a starter github repository for this video game [you can find here.](https://github.com/ajaj895/Bug-Hunter)

That rounds out the first Bug Hunter blog post, there will be more to come.
